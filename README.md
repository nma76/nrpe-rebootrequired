# nrpe-rebootrequired
This plugin monitors the need for reboot on Ubuntu/Debian systems. It also shows the reason reboot is required.

This first version is only tested on my developer machine which runt on MacOS 10.13.3, and it√§s only tested with simulated files.

Currently this plugin return status:
OK      - when no reboot is required
WARNING - when reboot is required. Reason for the rebbot is shown in the message.
UNKNOWN - when the plugin is unable to get any status
